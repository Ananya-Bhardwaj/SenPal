# SenPal

It is aptly said that ‘Caring for our seniors is perhaps the greatest responsibility we have. Those who walked before us have given so much and made possible the life we all enjoy.’ And as the youth , its our shared responsibility to cater to their new needs.  

The needs which arise with old age, reducing learning capacity and advancing technology. It must have happened numerous times when our grandfather or grandmother would have struggled with adopting WhatsApp or searching on chrome or as simple as searching a bhajan or movie on YouTube. They time and again need assistance to get at ease with the interface and need help to operate them. Keeping this view in mind, we made ‘SenPal’, a telegram chatbot which assists senior citizens and caters to their day-to-day needs in few simple textual exchanges which gives them options for medical consultation, listening bhajans, shopping, watching news etc.
